# GRAPH_RECURSION_LIMIT

Your LangGraph app reached the maximum number of steps before hitting a stop condition.

This is usually a sign of an infinite loop, but complex graphs may hit this naturally.

## Troubleshooting

- If you are not expecting your graph to go through many iterations, you likely have a cycle. Check your logic for infinite loops.
- If you have a complex graph, you can pass in a higher `recursionLimit` value into your `config` object when invoking your graph like this:

```ts
await graph.invoke({...}, { recursionLimit: 100 });
```
